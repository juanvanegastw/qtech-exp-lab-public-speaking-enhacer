## Tips
* Risks: nervous, microexpresiones, lack of energy, distractors, being fake
Avoid sameness.  It is said that sameness is the enemy of speaking. If you follow the same cadence, vocal rhythm, pitch, tone and gesture patterns throughout your presentation, your audience will tune you out. Think about what puts a baby to sleep. You need to change it up; keep enough variety in your delivery so it holds the audience’s interest.

* Message your body.  
Remember that 90+% of communication is nonverbal. Your audience will read your facial expressions, the tone of your voice, the way you use your hands, how you stand and move. A warm, easy smile and calm body immediately tell the audience that you’re comfortable and confident. And when the speaker is comfortable, the audience is, too. The opposite is also true.

* “When your heart starts pounding, you’re sweating, your hands are shaking, your knees are shaking, and you feel like you’re going to pass out — that’s the way everybody feels,”
“It’s a skill, not a talent.”
Marjorie L. North, a speech pathologist and lecturer at Harvard University

* People who are more introverted tend to keep a lot of ideas in their heads and on top of mind to keep their brain from getting bored, rather than relying on other people or activities to keep their minds occupied, Jadzia Jagiellowicz, PhD (Psch), a cognitive psychologist, told NBC — “they have an exciting ‘inner life.’” And that’s why too much stimulation and excitement (for example a full room of people whose eyes and attention are all focused on you) can be overwhelming for people who are more introverted, she says.

* You have to give yourself to your audience. Any second you spend being self-conscious, you’re not paying attention to your audience, she says. “The good speaker is the one who leans forward and says who are you? What do you need? How can I help you?”
Carol Fleming, PhD, a San Francisco-based communications coach and author of It's the Way You Say It

* Make eye contact with your audience.
This is important whether you’re speaking or listening, North says. It communicates to both listener and speaker that you’re engaged and you care. “Your personality comes through much better and you look more competent and confident.”

* And if you’re addressing a large crowd, remember good eye contact doesn’t mean just finding the one smiling face to stare down for the duration of your talk, North says. Look at everyone.

* Stand up straight.
We’re not talking toy soldier straight, but if you’re in front of a crowd (no matter what size) good posture helps support your voice, North says. Plant your feet on the ground and distribute your weight evenly between them. Don’t cross your legs, North adds — “even behind a podium, you can tell.”

* And don’t rock, she says. It’s a surefire way to draw attention to what you look like rather than what you’re saying.
